Sonnet is particularly good at:\n\n- Coding: Autonomously writes, edits, and runs code with reasoning and troubleshooting\n- Data science: Augments human data science expertise; navigates unstructured data while using multiple tools for insights\n- Visual processing: excelling at interpreting charts, graphs, and images, accurately transcribing text to derive insights beyond just the text alone\n- Agentic tasks: exceptional tool use, making it great at agentic tasks (i.e. complex, multi-step problem solving tasks that require engaging with other systems)\n\nFor the latest version (2024-10-23), check out [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet).\n\n#multimodal",
